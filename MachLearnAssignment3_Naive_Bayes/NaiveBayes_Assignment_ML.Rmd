#Q2 - Consider the task of classifying a customer who owns a bank credit card and is actively using online banking services. Looking at the pivot table, 
# what is the probability that this customer will accept the loan offer? 
# Answer - 88/88+779 = 0.1014 or 10.14%

#Q3 Create two separate pivot tables for the training data. One will have Loan (rows) as a function of Online (columns) and the other will have Loan (rows) 
# as a function of CC.

train_cast1 <- cast(train_melt1,Personal.Loan~variable, value = "Online" )
train_cast2 <- cast(train_melt2, CreditCard~variable, value = "Online")

#Q4 - Compute the following quantities [P(A | B) means “the probability ofA given B”]: 
# i. P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) (the proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors) 

table(Train_UB[,c(10,14)])

#Answer - P(CC=1|Loan=1) = 88/(88+193)=88/281=0.3809 or 38.09%

# iii. P(Loan = 1) (the proportion of loan acceptors)

#Answer- P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0) = 1605/(1605+1115) = 0.59007352941 or 59.01%

#vi. P(Loan = 0)

table(Train_UB[,10])

#Answer- P(Loan = 0) = 2720/(2720+281)= 0.9064 or 90.64%


#Q5 - Use the quantities computed above to compute the naive Bayes probability P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1).

# Naive Bayes probability = 
# P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1) = P(CC=1|Loan=1)*P(Online=1|Loan=1)*P(Loan = 1)/[(P(CC=1|Loan=1)*P(Online=1|Loan=1)*P(Loan=1))+ (P(CC=1|Loan=0)*P(Online=1|Loan=0)*P(Loan=0)]
# = [88/(88+193)]*[174/(107+174)]*[281/(281+2720)]/[88/(88+193)]*[174/(107+174)]*[281/(281+2720)]+[779/(779+1941)]*[1605/(1605+1115)]*[2720/(2720+281)]
# = 0.3809*0.6192*0.0936/(0.3809*0.6192*0.0936)+(0.2863*0.5900*0.9064)
# = 0.1261 or 12.61%


#Q6 - Compare this value with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B). Which is a more accurate estimate?
# Answer - 

#Q7 - Which of the entries in this table are needed for computing P (Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1)? 
#In R, run naive Bayes on the data. Examine the model output on training data, and find the entry that corresponds to P (Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1).
#Compare this to the number you obtained in (e).
