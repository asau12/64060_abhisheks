Pdata <- read.csv("Pharmaceuticals.csv")
head(Pdata)

plot(Market_Cap~Rev_Growth, Pdata)
with(Pdata, text(Market_Cap~Rev_Growth, labels=Symbol, pos=4, cex=0.4)) #A rough estimate of how the distribution is for Market cap vs revenue growth

K-means clustering model

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(factoextra)
library(ISLR)

Pdata1 <- scale(Pdata[, c(3:11)], center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

dist_pdata <- get_dist(Pdata1)
print(dist_pdata, digits = 3)

heatmap(Pdata1, scale = "column")

#Company 8 and 17 are the furthest from each other as the distance between them is the largest i.e 7.18. 
Pdata[c(8,17),] #From this we can see that there is a huge difference in terms of Market capital, Rev_Growth and Net Profit margin of both these companies

boxplot(Pdata1, col=c("deepskyblue","deepskyblue4","cadetblue","cadetblue1","cadetblue2","cadetblue3","cadetblue4","dodgerblue", "dodgerblue4"), las = 2) #visualization of the outliers

```

Finding optimal number for K as per Elbow method

```{r}


fviz_nbclust(Pdata1, kmeans, method = "wss") +
 geom_vline(xintercept = 2, linetype = 5)       #Elbow method

fviz_nbclust(Pdata1, kmeans, method = "silhouette") #Silhouette Method

```
Silhouette method of finding optimal number of K is highly influenced by outliers. Since our data has quite a few number of outliers. 

On removing the outliers, the optimal value of K using the silhouette method also came out to be 2.

Hence, We can consider the optimal number of K using the Elbow method.

```{r}

#k=2
k_mean_model2 <- kmeans(Pdata1, centers = 2, nstart = 25) 
fviz_cluster(k_mean_model2, data = Pdata1)+ labs(subtitle = "k=2")

k_mean_model2 

```


```{r}

Pdata2 <- Pdata[-c(3:11)] %>% mutate(data.frame(k_mean_model2$cluster))

library("writexl")
write_xlsx(Pdata2, "D:\\Study\\Assignments\\MachLearn\\MachLearnAssignment4_KmeansClustering\\Pdata2.xlsx")

Q. Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.

A- Low Market Cap companies are in cluster 1 and High Market cap companies are in Cluster 2 (As per the report above)

Q. Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters.

A. For the same values of Return on equity, companies in cluster 2 have a higer Return on Equity than companies in cluster 1.
